## Run code
T ran the code in Kaggle, I recommend you to upload the notebooks in ``\kaggle_notebooks`` folder and relevant dataset and trained models to Kaggle to run. You need to create a [Wandb](https://wandb.ai/site) account and get the key to run the RetroMAE pretraining and Cross-encoder training notebooks.
